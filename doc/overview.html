<p>Pipeliner provides a template to define complex pipelines and run them in
    Jenkins.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>What is a Pipeline</h3>
<p>A Pipeline provides a structured way to define the functionality of a job,
    associate inputs and default values among many other things. Pipelines are
    defined as <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a> classes. </p>
<h3>What does Pipeliner do</h3>
<p>Pipeliner is the component that defines the template for these pipelines and
    evenutally processes these pipelines. It also parses user inputs to
    pipelines, configures pipelines and provides utility functions.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Pipeliner in itself is only a runner for the pipelines a project sets up and
    maintains. It does not contain any runnable pipelines except some example
    pipelines for reference.</p>
<p>To set it up one needs to use <a
        href="https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/">Jenkins'
        Shared Libraries</a> functionality to load Pipeliner and the project
    specific library where all the pipelines and stages are specified.</p>

<h2>Project specific pipelines and stages</h2>
<p>Every project which uses Pipeliner will have their project specific
    pipelines. Those should be provided in a seperate git repository as another
    shared library. Every pipeline needs to be a class which extends the
BasePipeline class and defines it's specific input parameters and stages. Stages
should be reusable functions stored in a seperate directory.</p>

<h2>Inputs to the pipeline</h2>
There are 4 ways of setting up inputs for the pipeline: merge request message,
parameters in Jenkins job, global environment variables, environment variables
in Jenkinsfile. 

<h3>Merge Request Message</h3>
<p>The InputParser expects a message which can for example be provided from a
    pull request or merge request description from web UI. The message needs to
    adhere to a specific syntax so it can be parsed and understood by the
    parser. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
  This is a merge request description it can span over several lines

  Like this for example, but there needs to be a delimiter at the end which
  seperates the normal message from the data which is supposed to be parsed
  by the parser.
  --
  key = value
  listKeys = five six

</pre>
<p>The message delimiter is two or more dashes on a new line without any other
    characters.</p>
<p>The syntax for the rest of the data is key-value pairs with a equals sign
    between them. Keys are case insensetive and should only contain ASCII
    characters. Values can be either a string or a list of strings seperated by
    the pipe character.</p>
<p>Everything will be trimmed of whitespaces to the left and right before it
    goes in as machine readable data into Pipeliner.</p>
<p>Be aware that the parser only supports string and list of string types, no
    bolean or other types. </p>

<h3>Parameters in Jenkins Job</h3>
<p>
    Note: Gitlab project jobs cannot be parameterized by this method.<br>
    Go to the <b>Configue</b> of the Jenkins job, and follow the setup of the
    screenshort below, be aware of that, the name of the variables need to be prefix
    with "PIP_" case-insensitive, to be able to separate with other normal
    Jenkins parameters, so that the pipeliner InputParser will understand they
    are for the pipeliner specifically.

<h3>Global Environment Variables</h3>
<p>
    Setting up global environment variables is quite similar with the parameters
    in Jenkins job. Go to <b>Manage Jenkins</b> -> <b>Configue System</b> ->
    <b>Global properties</b>, then check the <b>Environment variables</b>, and
    add environment variables as shown below. Also remember the PIP_ prefix.
</p>

<h3>Environment Variables in Jenkinsfile</h3>
<p>
    As we are using pipeliner, the heavy part of the logic are in
    pipeliner-depot now, the current Jenkinsfile will end up with only oneline
    like:
    <pre>
        execYoctoPipeline()
    </pre>
    And the environment variables need be configued above this line, e.g.
    <pre>
        env.PIP_TARGETS="rpi3_nogfx:core-image-base qemu-x86-64_nogfx:core-image-minimal"
    </pre>
</p>

<b>Note:</b> The priorities of the four methods are Merge Request Message >
Jenkinsfile > Jenkins Job Configure > Global Environment <br/>
Higher priority settings always overrides lower ones if they are set in the same time.
